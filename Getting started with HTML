# Section 2 : Getting started with HTML
This file is a simple cheat sheet for some basic HTML syntax which I learn from the udemy class. It will also include some comments if I think it is necesary.

  Note: Every time we write a tag, we need to write a closed tag! A closed tag is similar to the initial tag but with a "/" inside.
  
  * `<html>` Beginnering of a HTML file
  * `<body>` Content of a HTML file 
  * `<h1>` Header of a HTML file. Note: For any tags like `<h2>`, they are also head tags but remember, the larger the number next to h is, the smaller the header is.
  * `<title>` Title of my page. It will show at my broswer tag.
